# Tax Ninja Samurai - Real-time Tax Liability Simulator

## Overview

This Python script simulates a financial system where a Tax Ninja Samurai calculates real-time tax liability based on financial transactions. The program uses multithreading to simulate transactions over time.

## Components

1. **Transaction Class:**
   - Represents a financial transaction with an amount and timestamp.
   - Created within the `TaxNinjaSamurai` class to track transactions.

2. **TaxNinjaSamurai Class:**
   - Manages tax-related calculations and transactions.
   - Includes methods to add transactions and calculate tax liability.
   - Utilizes a threading lock to ensure thread safety.

3. **simulate_transactions Function:**
   - Simulates financial transactions in a separate thread.
   - Adds transactions to the `TaxNinjaSamurai` instance.

4. **main Function:**
   - Initializes a `TaxNinjaSamurai` instance with a specified tax rate.
   - Simulates transactions in a separate thread while the main thread performs other tasks.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using a Python interpreter: `python tax_ninja_samurai.py`.

2. **Output:**
   - The script will output real-time tax liability information based on simulated transactions.

## Dependencies

- The script uses the `threading` module for multithreading.
- No additional external libraries are required.

## Notes

- Adjust the tax rate and transaction amounts in the script to observe different tax liabilities.
- The program showcases a simple example and can be extended for more complex scenarios.
